## DEPRECATED: Railway configuration
## This file was used by Railway to configure build and deploy settings.
## The project now targets Render; use `render.yaml` and
## `RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` for deployment details.

# (Railway config removed) - no action required. Kept for historical reference.
